What is javascript and why we used ?

-Javascript is logic based programming language where we can our code project functionality in that.
-Javascript is a high level programming language for build web pages.
-Now we4 used the ES6(Echma script 6) version of javascript, in other words we called vanila javascript.
-Runtime environment of javascript is node.js.

VARIABLE:-

--Variable is a container to store some data.
-in javascript we hava 3 types of variables
1. let:-
   -let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
   -Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
   -Let is a block scope code so we hava been using let for most of the cases'
2. Var:-
    -Var is a type of variable which is also  used for changing the variable later stage.
    -Var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are dont use var most of the time.
3. const:-
    -Const is a type of variable where we can't chnage our data further.
    -Const means constant to store some data like numbers,integer etc...

Task:-
    1.Diff bet let and var
    2.Diff bet const and var
    3.What do you means by hoisting.


Ans:-
1.
            let                                                     var

    -The let is also a keyword that is used              -The var is a keyword that is used to declare a variable
    to declare a variable.

    -The variables that are defined with let             -The variables that are defined with var statement have function scope
        statement have block scope

    -let is hoisted but inaccessible due to              -Hoisting is allowed with var
       temporal dead zone    

     -   Syntax -:                                         -    Syntax -:

      let name = value                                      var name = value;  

     -let is a feature of ES6.                            -var is an ECMAScript1 feature.

Rules of variable:-

-Variable names are case sensative "a" & "A" is different.
-Only letter, digit,underscore & $ is allowed(not even space).
-Only letter,underscore or $ should be 1st charachter.
-Reserver words cannot be variable names.

DATATYPES:-

-Datatype is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system hoe to interpret its value.
-In data types we used typeof() operater to know the what type of data it is.
-Mainly in javascript thire are 2 types of data types.

1. Primitive:-
  - In javascript there are 7 types of primitive data types.
    1. Number :-
            -Number are the type of datatype those it contain some numerical value.
    2. String :-
            -String is a type of data type thet can hold some character like names....
    3. Boolean :-
            -In boolean data type we get boolean value like true or false.
    4. Undefined :-
            -in undefined data types the data is not define so that it will show undefined.
    5. Null :-
            -In this data type we get null for the value means nothing.
    6. Bigint :-
            -In bigint we will get big integer.
    7. Symbol :-
            -In symbol we will get whole symbol as well as value we get for the data type.


2. Non-Primitive or Reference:-

    -Non-primitive data types are the type of data type that can hold multiple of item in a single time.
    --Non primitive data types are - object, array, function.

        1. Object:-
            -object is a non primitive data types which can hold multiple of item in one single entity.
            -Mainly obkects are working on(key:value)pair.
            -The left hande side is our keys and right hand side are the value of the following onject.

            Example:-
              let person={
                name= "HANUMAN",
                age=200,
                country=not limits 

              };
